##  **Literalura: A Text-Based Interactive Book Catalog**

### **Project Description**

**Literalura** is a Java application that allows users to interact with a book catalog through a text-based console interface. Users can search for books by title, view saved books, explore authors, filter authors by time period, and list books by language.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **Java:** The primary programming language for the application.
*   **Spring Boot:** A framework for building Java applications, providing features like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and embedded servers.
*   **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database access and object-relational mapping.
*   **PostgreSQL:** The chosen relational database for storing book and author information.
*   **Jackson Libraries:** For handling JSON data parsing and serialization.
*   **Gutendex API:** An external API used to fetch book information.

**Challenges Faced and Future Features:**

The available source code does not provide information about specific challenges encountered during development or plans for future features.

### **Installation**

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17 is specified in the POM.xml.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A running PostgreSQL database instance is required.
*   **Maven:** The project uses Maven as its build tool.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Morefew/literalura.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd literalura
    ```
3.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    *   Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database connection details:
        ```
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/literalura
        spring.datasource.username={DB_USER}
        spring.datasource.password={DB_PASS}
        ```
4.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Execute the generated JAR file:
        ```bash
        java -jar target/literalura-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```
    *   The application will start and present the interactive menu.

### **How to Use**

**Interacting with the Application:**

Literalura provides a text-based menu-driven interface:

*   **Search for a Book by Title:** Users can input a book title, and the application retrieves matching books from the Gutendex API using the base URL `https://gutendex.com/books/?search=`. The results display the book's ID, title, author, language, and download count. The application returns an error message if there are no results.
*   **List Saved Books:** Displays a list of books previously saved by the user from search results. Books are sorted alphabetically by title.
*   **List All Authors:** Shows a list of all authors retrieved from the Gutendex API. This feature assumes author information is stored along with saved books. Authors are sorted alphabetically by name.
*   **List Authors Alive During a Time Period:** Allows users to specify a start and end year to filter authors who were alive within that range.
*   **List Books by Language:** Enables users to search for books in a specific language.

**Example Usage:**

*   To search for "Pride and Prejudice":
    ```
    1 - Buscar Libro por TÃ­tulo
    ```
    *   Enter the title: "Pride and Prejudice".
    *   The application will display matching books from the Gutendex API.
*   To list books saved in the database:
    ```
    2 - Lista de Libros Salvados 
    ```
    *   The application will show the saved books.
